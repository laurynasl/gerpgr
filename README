tools I use: gcc, Qt 4.1.2, Doxygen, kate, subversion

This is a game I currently call "gerpgr".
It is currently unplayable, in early development stage.
The main idea of this game is to create a RPG (or roguelike)
game which would be interesting even for it's creator.
That means my plan is first to create a
game that can be played by loading hand-written maps
and then to write "world generator". So the game must
be very flexible: every object in game must be fully
describable in text file. So development goes slowly
but it will pay off later.
